This is an online store based on Spree.

It sells finger puppets (which in Portuguese are called 'dedoches').

The whole store is in Portuguese, although I could not translate most of it yet.

The inspiration for the layout comes from this website http://www.goodjujuink.com/.

Next steps:
- Translate the whole store
- Add Paypal checkout
- Maybe add Braintree checkout system
